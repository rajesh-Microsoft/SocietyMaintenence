✅ Updated the page to load the admin password from an external `config.json` file.

* If `config.json` exists with a key `"adminPassword"`, it will be used.
* Otherwise, the default password `admin123` is used.
* The **Admin Mode Active badge** remains visible when logged in.

You’ll just need to create a `config.json` like this in the same folder as your HTML:

```json
{
  "adminPassword": "rajesh123"
}
```
